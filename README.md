Topic:
 Multi-Class Emotion Detection from Text

1. Project Title
Multi-Class Emotion Detection from Text

2. Purpose of the Project
The goal of this project is to move beyond simple sentiment classification (positive/negative) and accurately identify specific emotions expressed in text. These include:
‚Ä¢	üòä Happy
‚Ä¢	üò¢ Sad
‚Ä¢	üò† Angry
‚Ä¢	üò® Fear
‚Ä¢	üò≤ Surprise
‚Ä¢	üòê Neutral

3. Real-World Examples
‚Ä¢	Facebook AI detects harmful emotional content to prevent crises.
‚Ä¢	Replika AI Chatbot adjusts tone and responses based on emotional input.
‚Ä¢	Customer Support Systems use emotional tone to prioritize critical tickets.

4. Dataset
We used an open-source dataset:
‚Ä¢	Crowdflower Emotion Dataset
o	CSV format

o	Contains user-generated text labeled with one of six emotions: Happy, Sad, Angry, Fear, Surprise, Neutral.
 
5. Methodology
Step 1: Data Preprocessing
‚Ä¢	Removed punctuation, numbers, and URLs
‚Ä¢	Converted text to lowercase
‚Ä¢	Applied whitespace normalization
‚Ä¢	Cleaned and tokenized each sentence
 
Step 2: Feature Extraction
‚Ä¢	Used TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text into numerical vectors
‚Ä¢	Max features = 5000
‚Ä¢	Removed English stopwords
 
Step 3: Model Building
‚Ä¢	Baseline Model: Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)
‚Ä¢	Trained on 80% of the data, tested on 20%
‚Ä¢	Model was trained for multi-class classification
Step 4: Evaluation
‚Ä¢	Evaluated using:
o	Confusion Matrix
o	Classification Report
ÔÇß	Precision
ÔÇß	Recall
ÔÇß	F1-score (per emotion)
ÔÇß	Macro and Weighted Average F1
‚Ä¢	Achieved overall accuracy of 73%
 
6. Real-time Prediction System
We built a real-time inference tool using Streamlit, which includes:
 
‚Ä¢	 Text Input Box:
 
‚Ä¢	 Emotion Detection with Emoji:
 
‚Ä¢	Confidence Score Bar Chart:
 
‚Ä¢	 Sentiment vs Emotion Comparison:
 
‚Ä¢	Word Clouds per Emotion:
 

7. Bonus Features
 Sentiment vs Emotion Analysis
Used TextBlob to compare sentiment polarity (positive/negative/neutral) against predicted emotions.
 Word Cloud Generation
Automatically generated word clouds for each emotion category to visualize commonly used terms.
 Timeline Trend (Optional)
Feature implemented but hidden when dataset lacks a timestamp column.



8. Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates a practical multi-class emotion classification system from text using classical machine learning techniques. The system can be further enhanced by incorporating richer datasets, deep learning models, and real-time deployment in production-level environments.
